# Counsel Brief — Hollow House Institute Master License Suite

## Purpose

This repository establishes a private licensing and governance authority for sensitive behavioral, relational, and longitudinal AI materials.

The objective is to:
- Prevent unauthorized AI training and derivative exploitation
- Maintain longitudinal behavioral integrity
- Enforce ethical and identity-protective constraints
- Provide regulator- and enterprise-readable governance artifacts

---

## Structure

The system consists of:

1. **HHI-LIC-01** — Master Licensing & Governance Standard  
2. **Master License Suite Repository** — Canonical authority  
3. **Individual License Instruments** — Material-specific constraints  
4. **Security & Enforcement Policy** — Misuse and breach handling  

All materials are **restricted-access by default**.  
No implied rights are granted.
