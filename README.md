## Canonical Licensing Authority

This repository is the **sole canonical licensing authority** for all Hollow House Institute (HHI) intellectual property.

All licensing terms governing HHI materials originate here.  
No downstream repository, dataset, document, or artifact may define, modify, or reinterpret licensing terms independently.

In the event of conflict, this repository prevails.

---

## Purpose

The Master License Suite exists to:
- define binding license terms for HHI intellectual property
- establish permitted and prohibited uses
- govern commercial, research, derivative, and training usage
- provide a single enforcement and interpretation surface

This repository contains **license texts and licensing doctrine only**.  
It does not contain datasets, research, models, or tooling.

---

## Scope of Coverage

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing, the licenses defined in this repository govern:

- datasets
- documentation
- research papers
- standards
- schemas
- code
- tooling
- derivative works
- model training and fine-tuning usage
- redistributions and transformations

No material is open-use by default.

## License Structure

This repository functions as a **license index and authority layer**.

Each license is defined in its own file and applies only according to its stated scope.

Examples include (non-exhaustive):
- Research-only licenses
- Non-commercial licenses
- Commercial-use licenses
- Derivative and redistribution-restricted licenses
- Training and model-integration restricted licenses

Refer to the individual license texts in this repository for binding terms.

## Relationship to Other Repositories

All Hollow House Institute repositories **inherit** licensing terms from this Master License Suite unless a written exception is explicitly declared here.

Downstream repositories may reference licenses but may not redefine them.

---

## Enforcement & Interpretation

- Use of HHI materials constitutes acceptance of the applicable license terms.
- Unauthorized use, redistribution, training, or derivation is prohibited.
- Interpretive authority resides exclusively with Hollow House Institute.
